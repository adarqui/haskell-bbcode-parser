^^ Will eventually grow into a fierce honey badger.

## cool stuff

Some may find this interesting. I basically copied all of my code over from purescript-bbcode-parser to haskell-bbcode-parser, and renamed the .purs files to .hs. Then, I slowly chipped away at it until everything worked, including the tests that were ported over.

For historical reasons, if anyone wants to see what needed to be done to get this code ported from purescript to haskell, refer to commits prior to this hash: 7a57bbe8ae1a517e45f1f74d0bd5bfd4c01f9bbc
